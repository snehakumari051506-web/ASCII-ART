# ASCII-ART
# 🎨 Image-to-ASCII-Art Generator  A robust Python utility that converts standard images into high-quality ASCII text art. This project is built using a **library-free** approach for core processing, interacting directly with binary image data to perform pixel-to-character mapping.  ---  ## 📝 Project Overview  This project transforms digital images (specifically 24-bit BMP files) into structural ASCII patterns. By calculating the luminance of each pixel and mapping it to a specific character's visual density, the script generates a text-based representation of the original photo.  ### Key Highlights - **Zero Dependencies:** No `PIL`, `OpenCV`, or `numpy` required for the core conversion. - **Binary Parsing:** Manually extracts metadata and pixel arrays from the BMP file structure. - **Grayscale Optimization:** Uses the weighted luminance formula:    $$Y = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B$$  ---

## 🛠️ Methodology  The conversion follows a structured pipeline as outlined in the project documentation:  1. **Character Repetition Function**: A density-based character ramp is used to ensure high-fidelity shading (from heavy symbols like `@` to light ones like `.`). 2. **Row-wise Pattern Construction**: The script reads the binary pixel data row-by-row, handling 24-bit color channels and row padding. 3. **Sequential Rendering**: The ASCII characters are rendered sequentially to the terminal, with aspect ratio correction ($0.55$ height scaling) to prevent image stretching.  ---  ## 🚀 Getting Started  ### Prerequisites * Python 3.x installed. * An image saved as a **24-bit BMP (.bmp)** file.  ##
